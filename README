The goal of this project is to provide a multi-language and
cross-platform set of libraries for accessing HCS data through a
single interface, regardless of the backend used to store the data.

The initial language targets are:
- Python
- Matlab
- Java(?) (might be easiest path for Matlab)

The initial backends to be supported are:
- CellProfiler 1.0 .MAT files
- CellProfiler 2.0 .MAT files (same as 1.0?)
- CellProfiler 2.0 MySQL databases (v1)
- CellProfiler 2.0 MySQL databases (v2)
- CellProfiler 2.0 sqlite3 databases
- GE INCell Analysis .XML files (code to convert these to CP2 sqlite
  files is available in the CellProfiler Analyst source)
- Whatever format iBrain2 uses
- Possibly, a new HDF5-based format

Goals:
- common interface for all backends
- concise code for all operations currently used in CPA and the
  multiple CellClassifiers
   - per-well and per-cell data (as well as per-image?)
   - classify cells by CPA's GentleBoost, SVM, RF-LDA, others...
   - select a random cell from an image/well/group/experiment
   - select a random cell of some particular class
   - fetch a feature's value for every cell in an
     image/well/group/experiment
   - score images, cells, wells
